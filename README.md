STPIHKAL (pronouned stuff-eye-call): A Sex Robot Love Story

Rendered version at [https://stpihkal.docs.buttplug.io/](https://stpihkal.docs.buttplug.io/)

## Introduction

STPIHKAL is a compendium of sex toy protocols, ranging from hardware
communications protocols, to firmware loaders, to video script
formats, to whatever else we find. If it controls a protocol in some
vaguely standard way, we'll document it and put it here.

The name STPIHKAL is an homage to [PIHKAL: A Chemical Love
Story](https://erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml).
We're just experimenting with sticking slightly different things in
our bodies.

## Building

To build STPIHKAL into HTML pages or pdfs, you'll need to use gitbook.
We have a node package file available to install the version we use
for development and build the book. Use the following commands to set
it up.

```
npm install
npm run build
```

This will build the HTML version of the book into the _book directory.

We keep a built version of the HTML version in our gh-pages branch,
and it is updated on every commit to master.
